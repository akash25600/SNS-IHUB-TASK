**Project Title: Data Science and AI Challenges**

**Overview**

This repository contains solutions for various data science and AI challenges, ranging from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text generation to API integration and data analysis. Each problem is solved using Python, with appropriate libraries and methodologies. The problems are designed to showcase different aspects of data science, AI, and API development.

**Contents**

Problem 1: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Problem 2: Text Generation
Problem 3: Prompt Engineering
Problem 4: Data Analysis
Problem 5: Live Coding Session - API Integration
Problem 1: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Problem Statement:
Implement a function to preprocess and tokenize text data.

**Requirements:**

Use libraries like NLTK or spaCy.
Handle punctuation, stop words, and different cases.
Evaluation Criteria:

Correctness of preprocessing steps.
Efficiency and readability of code.
Clean and structured code with comments.
Solution Overview: The solution involves:

Tokenizing the text using NLTK or spaCy.
Removing punctuation and stop words.
Normalizing case for consistency.

**Example Usage:**

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

text = "This is an example sentence, with punctuation!"
processed_text = preprocess_text(text)
print(processed_text)

**Problem 2: Text Generation**

**Problem Statement:**

Create a basic text generation model using a pre-trained transformer (e.g., GPT-3).

**Requirements:**

Use the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Generate coherent text based on a given prompt.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Ability to load and use pre-trained models.
Quality and coherence of the generated text.
Application of the transformer model.
Solution Overview: The implementation loads a pre-trained transformer model using Hugging Face's transformers library and generates text based on a user-specified prompt.

**Example Usage:**

python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt-3')
output = generator("Once upon a time", max_length=50)
print(output)

**Problem 3: Prompt Engineering**

**Problem Statement:**

Design and evaluate prompts to improve the performance of a given AI model on a specific task (e.g., summarization or question answering).

**Requirements:**

Experiment with different prompt designs.
Evaluate the effectiveness using metrics.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Creativity of prompt designs.
Effective use of evaluation metrics.
Clear documentation.

**Solution Overview:**

Experimented with prompts like "Summarize the following text:" and "Give a brief summary of the text below."
Used ROUGE score to evaluate summarization performance.

**Example Usage:**

python
Copy code
prompts = ["Summarize the following text:", "Provide a summary:"]
evaluate_prompts(prompts, model)
Problem 4: Data Analysis
Problem Statement:
Analyze a dataset and generate insights using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

**Requirements:**

Use Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn.
Provide a Jupyter notebook with the analysis.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Accuracy and depth of analysis.
Quality and clarity of visualizations.
Well-documented code.
Solution Overview: This solution performs:

Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Statistical analysis using Pandas and NumPy.
Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

**Example Visualization:**

python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.histplot(data['column_name'])
plt.show()

**Problem 5: Live Coding Session - API Integration**

**Problem Statement:**

Develop a Python script to integrate with an external API and fetch data based on user input.

**Requirements:**

Use the Requests library to make API calls.
Handle API responses and errors gracefully.
Parse and display the fetched data.
Evaluation Criteria:

Correct implementation of API integration.
Handling of API responses and errors.
Clean and well-structured code.
Solution Overview: The solution integrates with an external API, handles different types of responses, and gracefully deals with errors such as timeouts or invalid requests.

**Example Usage:**

python
Copy code
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
else:
    print("Error fetching data.")
